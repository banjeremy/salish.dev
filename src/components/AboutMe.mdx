I've been working as a software engineer for the past 15 years. But I got started programming much earlier. As a kid I learned enough BASIC to write silly games on the green terminal of an IBM 5150. That was a long time ago, but that early fascination has driven me to devote my career to understanding and harnessing the power of software.

These days, I mostly use React, Typescript, and Node.js. This is often alongside a fullstack framework such as Next.js, RedwoodJS, or Remix, all of which I wield effectively. I have an eye for the details and I can create CSS that matches your Figma designs to the pixel. 

I also enjoy working with Swift and SwiftUI to build iOS and macOS apps. I've built apps for clients and independently, and I've published a few of them on the App Store. I'm always looking for new opportunities to build something useful, interesting or beautiful.
